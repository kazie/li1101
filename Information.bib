abstract = {Emerging technologies, particularly the synthesis of cryptographic software and tamper-resistant smart-card hardware into the electronic purse, will make the cost of entry into the currency-issuing `market' quite small. Many organisations may then wish to enter this market, for example as a means of supplying credit (as envisaged by F. Hayek, 1990), of raising finance, or of encouraging customer loyalty (explored by E. de Bono, 1994). Whereas the world's currencies are currently organised on territorial lines, we foresee a future in which currencies occupy (overlapping) niches according to the `virtual', as well as geographic, communities to which people belong and a vigorous `foreign' exchange market where people (or, more likely, their PCs) trade these currencies. Just a couple of years ago, the concept of electronic cash was unknown in the mass market, but soon it will be taken for granted and will be as widespread as credit cards and chequebooks are today-and the ramifications of such a widespread deployment deserve serious examination and debate},

abstract={This paper investigates the semiotics of Bitcoin, an electronic cash system that uses decentralized networking to enable irreversible payments. For enthusiasts, Bitcoin provides an alternative to currencies and payment systems that are seen to threaten users' privacy, limit personal liberty, and undermine the value of money through state and corporate oversight. Bitcoin's promise lies in its apparent capacity to resolve these concerns not through regulatory institutions or interpersonal trust, but through its cryptographic protocols. We characterize this semiotics as a "practical materialism" and suggest it replays debates about privacy, labor, and value. © 2013 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.},

abstract={This article explores the notion of 'perfect' money that Simmel introduces in The Philosophy of Money. Its aim is twofold: first, to connect this idea to his more general arguments about the nature of society and the ambivalence of modernity, and, second, to assess its relevance for contemporary debates about the future of money, especially following the global financial crisis. I argue that Simmel's concept of perfect money can be understood as utopian in two senses, conceptual and ethical, that correspond to the two interpretations he develops, in Soziologie, of the idea of a perfect society. This sheds light on an aspect of Simmel's writings that has attracted relatively little attention, namely his views on the relationship between money and socialism. Characterizing this relationship as a 'formal affinity', his remarks resonate with a long tradition of thought on monetary utopias that aim not for the abolition of money but its radical transformation as a means of improving society. This tradition is coming to the fore once again today, as the financial crisis has given new impetus to constructing forms of money - for example, LETS, Time Dollars, mutual credit, peer-to-peer lending and digital currencies such as Bitcoin - that provide viable alternatives to big banks. Understood in conjunction with his account of the 'tragedy' of individualism in modernity, such resonances demonstrate the enduring relevance of Simmel's work to the empirical and theoretical investigation of money. © The Author(s) 2012 Reprints and permissions: sagepub.co.uk/journalsPermissions.nav.},

We perform an in-depth investigation to understand what made Bitcoin so successful, while decades of research on cryptographic e-cash has not lead to a large-scale deployment. We ask also how Bitcoin could become a good candidate for a long-lived stable currency. In doing so, we identify several issues and attacks of Bitcoin, and propose suitable techniques to address them. © 2012 Springer-Verlag.},
