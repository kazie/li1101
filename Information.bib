abstract = {Emerging technologies, particularly the synthesis of cryptographic software and tamper-resistant smart-card hardware into the electronic purse, will make the cost of entry into the currency-issuing `market' quite small. Many organisations may then wish to enter this market, for example as a means of supplying credit (as envisaged by F. Hayek, 1990), of raising finance, or of encouraging customer loyalty (explored by E. de Bono, 1994). Whereas the world's currencies are currently organised on territorial lines, we foresee a future in which currencies occupy (overlapping) niches according to the `virtual', as well as geographic, communities to which people belong and a vigorous `foreign' exchange market where people (or, more likely, their PCs) trade these currencies. Just a couple of years ago, the concept of electronic cash was unknown in the mass market, but soon it will be taken for granted and will be as widespread as credit cards and chequebooks are today-and the ramifications of such a widespread deployment deserve serious examination and debate},

abstract={This paper investigates the semiotics of Bitcoin, an electronic cash system that uses decentralized networking to enable irreversible payments. For enthusiasts, Bitcoin provides an alternative to currencies and payment systems that are seen to threaten users' privacy, limit personal liberty, and undermine the value of money through state and corporate oversight. Bitcoin's promise lies in its apparent capacity to resolve these concerns not through regulatory institutions or interpersonal trust, but through its cryptographic protocols. We characterize this semiotics as a "practical materialism" and suggest it replays debates about privacy, labor, and value. © 2013 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.},

abstract={This article explores the notion of 'perfect' money that Simmel introduces in The Philosophy of Money. Its aim is twofold: first, to connect this idea to his more general arguments about the nature of society and the ambivalence of modernity, and, second, to assess its relevance for contemporary debates about the future of money, especially following the global financial crisis. I argue that Simmel's concept of perfect money can be understood as utopian in two senses, conceptual and ethical, that correspond to the two interpretations he develops, in Soziologie, of the idea of a perfect society. This sheds light on an aspect of Simmel's writings that has attracted relatively little attention, namely his views on the relationship between money and socialism. Characterizing this relationship as a 'formal affinity', his remarks resonate with a long tradition of thought on monetary utopias that aim not for the abolition of money but its radical transformation as a means of improving society. This tradition is coming to the fore once again today, as the financial crisis has given new impetus to constructing forms of money - for example, LETS, Time Dollars, mutual credit, peer-to-peer lending and digital currencies such as Bitcoin - that provide viable alternatives to big banks. Understood in conjunction with his account of the 'tragedy' of individualism in modernity, such resonances demonstrate the enduring relevance of Simmel's work to the empirical and theoretical investigation of money. © The Author(s) 2012 Reprints and permissions: sagepub.co.uk/journalsPermissions.nav.},

abstract={Bitcoin is quickly emerging as a popular digital payment system. However, in spite of its reliance on pseudonyms, Bitcoin raises a number of privacy concerns due to the fact that all of the transactions that take place are publicly announced in the system. In this paper, we investigate the privacy provisions in Bitcoin when it is used as a primary currency to support the daily transactions of individuals in a university setting. More specifically, we evaluate the privacy that is provided by Bitcoin (i) by analyzing the genuine Bitcoin system and (ii) through a simulator that faithfully mimics the use of Bitcoin within a university. In this setting, our results show that the profiles of almost 40\% of the users can be, to a large extent, recovered even when users adopt privacy measures recommended by Bitcoin. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that comprehensively analyzes, and evaluates the privacy implications of Bitcoin. © 2013 Springer-Verlag.},

abstract={Bitcoin has enjoyed wider adoption than any previous crypto- currency; yet its success has also attracted the attention of fraudsters who have taken advantage of operational insecurity and transaction irreversibility. We study the risk investors face from Bitcoin exchanges, which convert between Bitcoins and hard currency. We examine the track record of 40 Bitcoin exchanges established over the past three years, and find that 18 have since closed, with customer account balances often wiped out. Fraudsters are sometimes to blame, but not always. Using a proportional hazards model, we find that an exchange's transaction volume indicates whether or not it is likely to close. Less popular exchanges are more likely to be shut than popular ones. We also present a logistic regression showing that popular exchanges are more likely to suffer a security breach. © 2013 Springer-Verlag.},
